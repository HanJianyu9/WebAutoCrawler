WebAutoCrawler is a Python-based project that combines web scraping and automation techniques. It provides a framework and tools to automate web scraping tasks and extract data from websites. The project aims to simplify the process of collecting data from the web by automating the scraping process and providing flexibility for customization.

## Features

- Web scraping: Automate the extraction of data from websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.
- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks and workflows using tools like Selenium or PyAutoGUI.
- Data storage: Store the extracted data in various formats like CSV, JSON, or a database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/HanJianyu9/WebAutoCrawler.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Configure the scraping targets and settings in the `config.py` file.
- Customize the automation scripts in the `automation.py` file.

## Usage

1. Configure the scraping targets and settings in the `config.py` file. Specify the URLs, data to extract, and other scraping parameters.

2. Customize the automation scripts in the `automation.py` file. Use the provided functions and methods to automate tasks and workflows.

```python
from automation import Automation

automation = Automation()

# Example: Automate a workflow
def automate_workflow():
    automation.login('username', 'password')
    automation.perform_task1()
    automation.perform_task2()

# Run the automation workflow
automate_workflow()
Customize the automation workflow based on your specific requirements and the tasks you want to automate.

Run the crawler.py script to start the web scraping process:

python crawler.py
The script will automate the scraping process based on the configurations in the config.py file and store the extracted data in the specified format.
